I spent about 15 hours this time and really see the different. I spent most of my time finding the bug and mistake. Part of my time spending on finding the right location to add action and method

The top navigation does not appear on "more" page. Not sure why.

I only have time to add one optional project, which is tapping the status button should show the compose view w/ the keyboard
