I spent about 15 hours this time and really see the different. I spent most of my time finding the bug and mistake. Part of my time spending on finding the right location to add action and method

I only have time to add one optional project today, which is tapping the status button should show the compose view w/ the keyboard

When I've more time tonight, I'll try to play around with the more screen.
